# NFT-TrendFinder
This repository serves for the final project of the course https://github.com/vitekzkytek/PythonDataIES

The aim of the project is to reveal trendy characteristics of NFT Images on the second largest market pratform: https://rarible.com

Supervisor: Martin Hronec

What the project does?
1. NFT_TrendFinder collects the characteristics of the most expensive images from the NFT marketplace - Rarible ([link](https://rarible.com/)) in text format, passes them to the neural network - DALL-E ([link](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)), so that it produces new works of art. 
2. It shows the necessary for customers statistics, like:
- "Kardashians in the NFT world/Most expensive NFTs": determines the most expensive NFT along with characteristics - price, date of creation, description, artist
- "You wanna be on top/Characteristics of most expensive NFTs": using Meta (Key, Value) data to accumulate characteristics of top by price images in the text format
- "A little more and you're done/Making pairs of characteristics to fulfill description": preparing a text database with pairs of "trend" descriptions from previous point for a complete description

Why the project is useful?
The crypto-art industry is growing exponentially. This is facilitated by the strengthening of the organic union between human and machine, which involves the development of gamification and decoration of the virtual space as a whole. The fact that we are entering a new rapidly developing era does not mean at all that people are adjusting to its requirements just as quickly. So if a company or an individual user wants to keep up with the times - by that we mean quick earnings from trading on NFT marketplaces OR search for contemporary high-level artists and styles - but do not have an artistic background --- our NFT_TrendFinder will be able to lend them a helping hand by giving them a finished NFT and actual information about the market. Which will help them not to waste time on drawing and designing pictures and researching the marketplace.
